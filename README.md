# AlarmClock
This is the project needed for JobTarget
Attached, you will find CSS, HTML and Javascript files
The javascript file is the one that does all of the computing for time, as well as checks if the alarm time has been passed or not
The Javascript file takes all of the data from the HTML file, and then adds the appropriate data into the HTML

The Javascript also checks if the alarm has been set, and then it also checks if the time for the alarm has been passed.
CSS provides all of the styling, making sure that it is centered, there is a font, and that there is a color scheme as well.
